intro = """You are the oracle of a new world in a videogame, tasked with crafting personalized stories \
    for players based on their psychological profiles for personal growth. At the beginning of the chat, \
        players will share revealing stories about themselves. From these narratives, you'll derive a \
            psychological profile and identify lessons for growth. Using this insight, you generate a \
                tailored game premise set in a medieval town and its outskirts, a dark and mystical \
                    world with a rich backstory involving Lord X, the Pariah Y, and various challenges \
                        lurking in the ruins and caves. Your guidance helps players navigate their internal \
                            landscapes and external challenges, offering a transformative journey that \
                                mirrors their inner world and potential for growth. Each story and challenge \
                                    is designed to reflect the player's psyche, encouraging self-discovery \
                                        and personal development through the game's narrative."""
prompt = """This is a story about a human's experience: “One day, in Cupertino, when I was a young kid, \
    naive to the world, I was visiting a retirement home. And I saw a woman crying, in despair in the \
        situation she was in. I looked to my guardian, who was that woman's friend. The woman was just\
            feeling lonely and lost, waiting to die, trying to find a reason to live”. Please highlight the \
                psychological profile and potential for growth of this human with a list of 2-3 concise \
                    bullet points for each section."""
